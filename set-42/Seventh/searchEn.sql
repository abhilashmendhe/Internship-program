MARY S CHURCH (CNI), CAMP, PUNESt. Mary�s Church (CNI) located in the Cantonment-Camp area of Pune city is the oldest standing church structure in the mid-western region of India and was called �The Mother Church of the Deccan� by the former Metropolitan of the then Anglican Communion in this part of the world, The Most Reverend Bishop Reginald Heber.Built in the early 1820s and consecrated on the 3rd of July, 1825, this church building has since then been a place of worship for people from different walks of life even as it has served as a historical landmark. Initially it was built for the purpose of worship for British military officers who were from the Protestant denomination of the Church of England, i.e. the Anglican Church. Gradually, apart from military officers, civilians too who were Christians and subscribed to the faith and practice of the Anglican Church in India, began to worship here.With the Anglican Church in the northern region of India joining the union of the Church of North India in 1970, this church came under its banner since then although it continued to maintain some of its old traditions of worship pattern and order. This church has had regular worship services in English from the time of its establishment and has grown to presently have more than 300 families as its members who belong to different cultures. They come together to worship and testify to God�s faithfulness in either of the three worship services on Sundays (two that are in the traditional pattern and one which is contemporary in nature) or on weekday mornings. Apart from worshipping together, the members share in the life of the church through various fellowships (based on age and interests) and activities and in this way participate in the common witness of the church.News & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRead moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort Read more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary�s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune � 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright � 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Activities.html','St. Mary s Church Camp Pune, ActivitiesPrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > ActivitiesTweet ActivitiesWorshipThe Worship Sub-committee has been working along with the Presbyter to make the worship services as much as a blessing as possible for those who attend.Read moreStewardshipSuspendisse sit amet magna sed quam porta lobortis et sit amet leo.

One of them said, “The only thing lacking is the sound of praise to the Creator.” So God created music, and it was heard in the whisper of the wind and in the song of the birds. He also gave man the gift of song. And throughout all the ages, music has blessed multitudes of people. Singing God’s praises honors the Lord, edifies our brothers and sisters in Christ, and brings us joy.We at St. Mary s Choir are blessed with a wonderful choir which has become an important aspect of Church service. The Church was fortunate to have musically minded Reverends, who have nurtured a good taste of Music in its congregation. Special mention needs to be made here of Late Revd. D. S Pathak and Revd. Rev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah who were inspirational in teaching the congregation the sung liturgy (Anglican and CNI).Besides them the choir was privileged to have many choir conductors who trained the choristers at various Christmas Nine Lessons & Carols Services. . Presently under the leadership of Revd. Puia the choir is well structured into Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass sections. They have presented many songs and anthems in the church on various occasions. Presently there are around thirty regular members and by the grace of God we hope to fill the choir stalls in the coming year. Do join us and lift your hearts and voices in hymns of praise whenever you have the opportunity. If you have an inclination to sing and would like to lend your voice to making the services more meaningful you are most welcome to join us in the choir.Choir practices are held at 7:00 pm every Thursday in the church, please join us for praise & worship.Choir conductor: Ranjan SamuelViolin Player: Abhijit RoyPhoto gallery:Photos of St. Mary s Church Choir Back to homepage Monthly NewsletterNews & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRecently we have had two trekking to PUNE’s nearby forts ‘Torna’ and ‘Tikona’Read moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort We have a lot of activities planned for the children throughout the yearRead moreChurch Choir Participated in a Choir CompetitionOur Church choir participated in an Inter-Church Choir Competition, organized by St. Anne s ParishRead moreWomen s Fellowship hosted the World Day of PrayerOur Church choir participated in an Inter-Church Choir Competition, organized by St. Anne s ParishRead moreSenior Citizens had a great time at the picnicThe annual picnic is another wonderful event organised by the Church for the elderly.Read more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Church-office.html','St. Mary s Church - Church OfficePrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > Administration > Church OfficeTweet Church OfficeTimingsThe Church Office is open from Tuesday to Saturday every week from 10 am. to 6 pm.

Eventually on the \"basis of negotiations\" prepared by a series of Round Table Conferences, a plan of Church union was drawn up. A negotiating committee was constituted in 1951 by the Church bodies concerned - which were the United Church of Northern India, the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, the Methodist Church in Southern Asia and the Council of the Baptist Churches in Northern India. In 1957, the Church of the Brethren and the Disciples of Christ also joined in the negotiations. The plan reached its fourth and final edition in 1965 and, on that basis, the Church Union in North India was inaugurated on 29 November, 1970 in Nagpur. At the last moment, the Methodist Church in Southern Asia decided not to join the union. However, the Methodist Church, the British and the Australasian have joined the Union.The concern for unity of the Church grew out of a zeal for the mission of the Church, because a divided Church could not bear witness to the one Gospel and the one Lord in a country like India with diverse religions, languages, races and cultures. Through the process of negotiations and prayerful seeking of the guidance of Holy Spirit unity was achieved in the understanding and practice of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord s Supper, the three-fold ministry of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons and in the organizational structures of Pastorates, Dioceses and the Synod, Episcopacy was received and accepted as both constitutional and historic. Provision has been made for diverse liturgical practices and understandings of the divine revelation, provided that these do not violate the basic Faith and Order of the Church or disrupt the unity and fellowship within the Church.CNI Website link: http://www.cnisynod.org/ Back to homepage Ministriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Contact-Us.html','St. Mary s Church Camp Pune, A historical CNI Church in the city of PunePrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > Contact UsTweet Contact UsAddress:St. Mary s Church (C.N.I.)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001IndiaOffice: +91 20 26361207 / 64013534Email: cnistmarys@yahoo.com Office Timings:Tuesday to Saturday10:00 AM to 6:00 PM The presbyter is available and to be met with prior appointment between10:00AM to 1:00 PmTuesday to Saturday View St. Mary s Church Camp Pune in a larger mapName:E-mail:Phone:Have:Query    Information    Feedback    SuggestionsYour comment: Back to homepage Ministriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/History.html','St. Mary s Church - Church HistoryPrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > About > Church HistoryChurch HistoryTweet The British originally came to India to trade. Gradually they worked themselves into power, and India became one of the countries of the British Empire. In Pune [Poonah, Poona] and its suburb Khadki [Kirkee] they had a large military set-up. It was therefore only natural that the British felt the need to have a church for their military personnel. Thus garrison churches came into existence. This is the oldest established Church in Poona or its neighbourhood. The Church was built by Lieut. Nash of the East India Company s Engineers. The tower at the west end of the church is surmounted by a mixture of lath and plaster.On the north and south of the tower are respectively vestry and lamp room on the ground floor, with a staircase on the south leading up to the gallery. The interior of the church is 97 feet long from the west door of the church step, and transept 88 feet long from north to south. The width of the naïve is 15 feet and transept 35 feet. The top of the spire is 103 feet from the ground. The eight round pillars, four on each side of the nave, are remarkable for the excellency of the chuna plastering with which they are covered having a surface almost like marble.The church accommodates over 1000 worshippers. The bell in the tower at present replaced the original one and was brought from Kaira Church. The Church foundation were laid by Bishop Reginald Heber (Image above) in 1825. The Bishop has left an excellent account of his journey up to Poona from Bombay. He describes the Church as spacious, convenient building but in bad architectural taste. The seating arrangements appear to have been altered by successive chaplains with a view to accommodate increased demands, as a military Church and to supply the needs of an increasing civilian population.The organ seems to have quiet a history of its own. It reached Poona in1869 when an organ chamber had to be built for its reception. Unfortunately in a few years time it became quite dilapidated, and was sent to England for repairs and its place was a harmonium. It was only in the year 1905 the organ, thoroughly repaired and renovated, was re-established and re-opened.Being the oldest and the most represented Church of Poona St. Mary s naturally contains a great many memorials of \"sages who wrote and warriors who bled\". The stone and brass plaques commemorate many noble names. One such person who was buried in the Church itself has placed over him the following inscription:\" Beneath this stone are the mortal remains of Sir Robert Grant (Image on the left) , Knight Grand Cross of the Guelphs of Hanover, one of Her Majesty s Most Honorable Privy Councilors and the Governor of Bombay. He died at Daporee on the 9th July 1838, in the sixtieth year of his age\".The stained glass window over the communion table was erected by Colonel Nasmyth, a superintendent of Trigonometrical Survey. The late Mr.R.G.Oxenham, Director of Public Construction, designed the window. The north side depicts the Annunciation of the Virgin and Moses at the Burning Bush . The south side represents the Ascension and above ,the translation of Elisha. The middle window potrays Our Lord in Majesty whilst beneath is Moses in prayer for victory over Amalek. The Baptistery window, to the memory of Brigadier-General Sewell represents Noah s sacrifice, the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and the Circumcision and Baptism. The Lectern, which dates back to 1870, was executed by a native boy under the superintendence of Colonel Finch, from designs by a London firm. The Altar Cross was presented by a lady in memory of her brother.Beside these there are many monuments to the officers who died in action, and some who died here from other causes. This church was part of the Church of England, which later became an independent Province of the Anglican Communion with the name  Church of India, Pakistan, Burma & Ceylon . The word  Burma  was dropped after that country became independent. A major change occurred in 1970 when the Church of North India came into existence as a result of the union of six different church denominations, and this church became a part of the Church of North India. Back to homepage News & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRead moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort Read moreChurch Choir Participated in a Choir CompetitionRead moreWomen s Fellowship hosted the World Day of PrayerRead moreSenior Citizens had a great time at the picnicRead moreMonthly NewsletterMinistriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/index.html','St. Mary s Church Camp Pune, A historical Church in the city of PunePrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the �Request for Prayer� section and send it to us by clicking the �Request� button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the �Answered Prayer� section and clicking the �Inform� button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact Us  Tweet Service Timings SundayThe Lord s Supper8:00 AM   6:00 PMContemporary Worship10:30 AM Weekdays (Tue & Sat)Morning Worship7:30 AM Weekdays (Thu)Evening Worship6:00 PM The ChurchmanA monthly newsletterWorshipThe Worship Sub-committee has been working along with the Presbyter to make the worship services as much a blessing as possible for those who attend.Read moreStewardshipThe Stewardship Sub-committee has been working very hard to encourage members to participate more in the life of the church.Read moreOutreachThe Outreach Sub-committee takes care of the support of the church in evangelism and social work.Read moreNursery SchoolThe St. Mary�s Church Nursery School was started 26 years ago by the church to help provide quality education to the youngest age group of childrenRead more WELCOME TO ST. MARY S CHURCH (CNI), CAMP, PUNESt. Mary�s Church (CNI) located in the Cantonment-Camp area of Pune city is the oldest standing church structure in the mid-western region of India and was called �The Mother Church of the Deccan� by the former Metropolitan of the then Anglican Communion in this part of the world, The Most Reverend Bishop Reginald Heber.Built in the early 1820s and consecrated on the 3rd of July, 1825, this church building has since then been a place of worship for people from different walks of life even as it has served as a historical landmark. Initially it was built for the purpose of worship for British military officers who were from the Protestant denomination of the Church of England, i.e. the Anglican Church. Gradually, apart from military officers, civilians too who were Christians and subscribed to the faith and practice of the Anglican Church in India, began to worship here.With the Anglican Church in the northern region of India joining the union of the Church of North India in 1970, this church came under its banner since then although it continued to maintain some of its old traditions of worship pattern and order. This church has had regular worship services in English from the time of its establishment and has grown to presently have more than 300 families as its members who belong to different cultures. They come together to worship and testify to God�s faithfulness in either of the three worship services on Sundays (two that are in the traditional pattern and one which is contemporary in nature) or on weekday mornings. Apart from worshipping together, the members share in the life of the church through various fellowships (based on age and interests) and activities and in this way participate in the common witness of the church.News & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRead moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort Read more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary�s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune � 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright � 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Mid-week-Intercessory-Prayer-Fellowship.html','St. Mary s Church - Mid-week Intercessory Prayer FellowshipPrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > Ministries > Mid-week Intercessory Prayer FellowshipTweet Mid-week Intercessory Prayer FellowshipThis is a weekly gathering of a few members coming together on Thursdays evenings in the church for a time of sharing various prayer needs of members of the church and others and to pray for them.

The school starts embedding - good qualities and education in a child at an early age thus making make him a useful citizen. The School under the able leadership of Mrs Dheera Das, one of the previous Headmistresses, was largely responsible for bringing the school from a small playgroup to a full fledged nursery with 130 students this year. This endevour has been commendably supported by sincere and hardworking teachers and staff. With the expansion came about the need to add different units to the once small playgroup. Now the classes are divided into PLAYGROUP, NURSERY, LOWER KG, UPPER KG based on the various age groups.\"A Healthy Body makes a Healthy mind\". To bring about a child’s overall development, a lot of outdoor and indoor activities are carried out. These range from various competitions viz: Handwriting competition, Spelling Olympiad, Art competition, to lighter activities like excursions and Magic show. A Country is made up by the people who live in it. To make children aware of various privileges they enjoy and to share these with those who don’t have them, we at St. Mary’s Church Nursery School make sure the students have many joint activities with the children of St. Johns Home. The highlight of these activities are the various skits, games and other events. The children freely mingle with each other thus enabling a feeling of bonding.The School has 3 major events every year. The PRIZE DISTRIBUTTION AND CULTURAL SHOW in September, CHRISTMAS PARTY AND NATIVTY PLAY in December and P.T DISPLAY in February. These programmes enable the parents to actively participate and get involved in their child s overall Development.. Pune is known as the Oxford of the East. There are many well known schools and colleges in and around the city. St. Mary s Nursery school is proud to state that after completing the pre school training here all our students get admissions and are well received in well known schools of the city . There are many plans for the further expansion of the School to make it a premier institution in the city. With the support of the Church and the unceasing prayers of its members, we are sure we will reach there sooner than planned. Till then we at St. Mary s Nursery School take pride in the smiles and gratitude of the students and their parents and look forward to great times ahead. Back to homepage Monthly NewsletterMinistriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead moreNews & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRecently we have had two trekking to PUNE’s nearby forts ‘Torna’ and ‘Tikona’Read moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort We have a lot of activities planned for the children throughout the yearRead moreChurch Choir Participated in a Choir CompetitionOur Church choir participated in an Inter-Church Choir Competition, organized by St. Anne s ParishRead moreWomen s Fellowship hosted the World Day of PrayerWe had arranged World Day of Prayer in our church on 2nd march 2012.

It is one of the key ministries at St. Mary’s where members meet up every first Friday of the month. These get-togethers are not only an opportunity to celebrate the Christian faith and discuss the word of God, but also very informative. The gatherings are facilitated by an appointed member of St. Mary’s Church who regularly invites clergy and other eminent people to talk and deliberate on relevant matters of interest, such as  geriatric care, will/ financial management, insurance etc. The annual picnic is another wonderful event organised by the Church for the elderly. The most recent one was held in Sept 2011, where the group were invited by the Deep Griha Society Pune, to spend a day at their ‘City of Child’ at Kasurdi 45 kms from Pune. As an open event we had younger members as well as the oldest member of our Church Ms. Rosemary Heysmond who joined us for the picnic.“Since my youth, God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvellous deeds. Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come.” Psalms 71: 17-18Aim & ObjectiveThe aim of the fellowship is to provide a loving environment to all our senior citizens where we pray, praise and glorify God for all his blessings and care. The fellowship also provides a supportive and helpful environment for elders to share their problems and difficulties. Furthermore, meeting with the sick and bereaved families enables the group to reach out and extend help as required.MembershipMembership to this group is a great opportunity for those who have retired/ completed sixty years to come share their testimonies and experiences for the betterment of fellow believers and the Church. Besides, there is always plenty of laughter, snacks and room for more. So come join us !For more details and any queries please contact the current co-ordinator for the Senior Citizens Fellowship, Mrs. Grace Williams from St. Mary’s Church, Pune.Photo gallery:Photos of Senior Citizens of St. Mary s Church Camp Pune Back to homepage News & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRead moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort Read moreChurch Choir Participated in a Choir CompetitionRead moreWomen s Fellowship hosted the World Day of PrayerRead moreSenior Citizens had a great time at the picnicRead moreMonthly NewsletterMinistriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Stewardship.html','St. Mary s Church - StewardshipPrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > Activities > StewardshipStewardship Tweet The Stewardship Sub-committee has been working very hard to encourage members to participate more in the life of the church.

Every Sunday the children gather together in the classrooms behind the church where we have a time of joyous singing and dancing. They are taught many action songs and choruses that make their time at Sunday School enjoyable. This is followed by lessons from the Bible.The classes in the Sunday schools are divided into 3 sections based on the age groups. The Syllabus is based on the understanding and learning capacities of the age groups. The children also are encouraged to take active part in Church and have special Sundays kept aside for them wherein they participate in the service right from Readings to Intercessory prayers. They add a special touch to that day’s worship by rendering inspirational skits and action songs.Sunday School schedule for the academic year 2012 - 2013CLASSAGE GROUPTEACHERSBeginners3 to 5 yrsSmita JoelKavita GaikwadQueenmary JamesAishwarya RaoPrimary6 to 8 yrsPrajakta BhaleraoVeronica RaoJuniors9 to 11 yrsPreeti NoelVictoria RobinsIntermediate12 to 14 yrsPamela NicholasRebecca PanhalkarSeniors15 yrs and aboveRuben KaleMilind NoelRaphael ShirsatPhoto gallery:Sunday School The children also are encouraged to take active part in Church and have special Sundays kept aside for them wherein they participate in the service right from Readings to Intercessory prayers. - Sunday School TeacherThe children have their regular set of enjoyment during the Christmas season, wherein they put up the Nativity play and truly herald the Christmas spirit by singing Carols.

In the past the church conducted the Alpha Course and this too was organized by this committee with the help of other members.  Back to homepage Ministriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014'),('http://www.stmaryschurchpune.com/Youth-Fellowship.html','St. Mary s Church - Youth FellowshipPrayer RequestIf you would like us to pray for any need that you or anyone you know may have, please write in the ‘Request for Prayer’ section and send it to us by clicking the ‘Request’ button.When you have received answer to your prayer request please do inform us for thanksgiving prayer by writing in the ‘Answered Prayer’ section and clicking the ‘Inform’ button.Request for PrayerName:  Prayer for: Answered PrayerName:  Answered Prayer:  Texte alternatif|Prayer Request Close Panel HomeAboutHistoryArchivesPresbytersRev.(Dr.) Kenseelan Azariah.Monthly PlannerThe ChurchmanNews & EventsChurch of North India (CNI)Worship ServicesMinistriesChurch ChoirSunday SchoolYouth FellowshipWomen s FellowshipActs Group FellowshipSenior Citizen s FellowshipBible Study FellowshipArea Prayer FellowshipMidweek Intercessory Prayer FellowshipAdministrationPastorate CommitteeSub CommitteesChurch OfficeActivitiesWorshipStewardshipOutreachNursery SchoolContact UsHome > Ministries > Youth FellowshipYouth Fellowship Tweet It is indeed a blessing for our church to have a very active youth fellowship which meets every Saturday behind the church, at 5 p.m. We discuss and debate on the biblical approach as youth towards life. We are also very active in the worship services of our church, helping with the ushering during the communion and also as lay Readers.Our activities over the last year have been as follows: We also come up with an outing plan every month like trekking, visiting old age homes, orphanages etc. to promote a healthy communication and spirit of togetherness among the youth members and as an integral part of the society. This has also helped us in developing a larger youth group as new members continue to join every now and then, few of them are non-Christians.We at present have a count of 30 members in our youth fellowship, who also get to confabulate through our youth fellowship facebook group. The youth takes care of the contemporary worship service of our church as well, by helping with the praise and worship sessions through songs and hymns.Recently we have gone trekking twice, to Torne and Tikona forts – both of which are forts near Pune.  It was a marvellous experience for all of us who chose to go for it. On both the occasions it was led by Mr. Dinshaw Eduljee a member of our church. He is willing to take us for many more as he himself is a professional trekker.  These treks have also helped many of our youth members to fill the communication gaps among us and I feel very happy to see them together confabulating more often.The youth fellowship happily invites all the youth to participate and experience the difference themselves.Youth office Bearers:Ashish Lakra [Youth President]Ketki Bhalerao [Secretary]Raymond Raj [Treasurer]Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/stmary.yf/ St. Mary’s Church, Youth Fellowship Back to homepage Monthly NewsletterMinistriesshow allChurch ChoirRead moreSunday SchoolRead moreYouth fellowshipRead moreWomen s FellowshipRead moreActs Group FellowshipRead moreSenior Citizens FellowshipRead moreNews & Eventsshow allYouth Fellowship trek to Torna FortRead moreSunday School Picnic to Sanskruti Resort Read moreChurch Choir Participated in a Choir CompetitionRead moreWomen s Fellowship hosted the World Day of PrayerRead moreSenior Citizens had a great time at the picnicRead more  Contact Information+91 20 26361207 +91 20 64013534 cnistmarys@yahoo.comSt. Mary’s Church (CNI)1-A Sholapur Road, CampPune – 411001ShortcutsRead Our HistoryView Church Monthly PlannerNews & EventsAbout Church of North India (CNI)Social ContactsFriend Us On FacebookFollow Us On TwitterWatch Us On YoutubeView Photos On FlickrCopyright Â© 2012 St. Mary s Church CNI Camp PuneUpdated On 4th Aug 2014');
